# Syntax to Bang out - C Programming

## Foundational
- Hello World
- Variable Declarations and Printing
    - int
    - float
    - char
    - double
- Simple Math - int and float
    - add
    - multiply
    - divide
- User input - scanf to read an integer and string and print it back

## Control Flow
- if - else
- Switch statements
- For loop
- while loop
- do while loop

## Functions
- Simple Function
- Recursive Function
    - Factorial
    - Fibonacci
- Void Function - returns nothing, just prints something

## Arrays & Strings
- Array Initialization
- Array Sum
- String Basics - Declare a char[], assign a word, and print it
- String Functions - write your own
    - strlen
    - strcpy

## Pointers
- Pointer basics - store an int, print its address, dereference it
- Pointer arithmetic - iterate over an array with a pointer
- Swap function - Swap two integers using pointers
- String with pointer - print each character of a string with pointer iteration

## Structs & Memory
- Struct Declaration - define a Person struct that has name and age. Use is
- Struct Array - array of struct Person
- Dynamic Memory - use `malloc` to allocate an int array, fill it, free it
- `Realloc` - grow an allocated array
- Custom Free Function - safely free allocated pointers

## File I/O
- Write to File - Write "Hello, File!" to a file
- Read from File - read and print file contents
- Count Lines - Count lines in a file

## Advanced Practice
- Implement a Linked List
    - insert
    - print
    - delete
- Binary Search (Array)
    - Iterative
    - Recursive
- Sorting Algorithm
    - bubble
    - insertion
    - merge
- Custom String Functions
    - `strcmp`
    - `strcat`
- Bitwise Ops
    - AND
    - OR
    - XOR
    - shifts
